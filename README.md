Glass-Gallery
=============

This project is exactly what the name is. As an Android developer, I simply wanted to explore the features, and see how Glass apps are made with the gdk. There was no way for me to view pictures/videos on the device, that I had taken with Glass, without having to find it somewhere on my Timeline. This can be very frustrating at times, since most people have a rather large Timeline

I wanted to recreate the Android Gallery app, and most of its functions, for Glass. The app acts as a live card on Glass where the user can either select Pictures or Videos that are on Glass itself. The media is ordered from newest to oldest.

This project is the result of what I did over a few days learning the gdk. I'm not actively working on the project anymore. Here are some of the features I initially intended to include in this app, that are not done:

- View Videos
- Media information for both Pictures and Videos.
- Option to share any media file
